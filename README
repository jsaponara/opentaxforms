OpenTaxForms opens and automates US tax forms--it reads PDF tax forms
(currently from IRS.gov only, not state forms), converts them to more
feature-full HTML5, and offers a database and API for developers to
create their own tax applications. The converted forms will be available
to test (and ultimately use) at
`OpenTaxForms.org <http://OpenTaxForms.org/>`__.

   |Build Status|

-  **Form status**

   The script reports a status for each form. Current status categories
   are:

   -  layout means textboxes and checkboxes--they should not overlap.
   -  refs are references to other forms--they should all be recognized
      (ie, in the list of all forms).
   -  math is the computed fields and their dependencies--each computed
      field should have at least one dependency, or else what is it
      computed from?

   Each status error has a corresponding warning in the log file, so
   they're easy to find. Each bugfix will likely reduce errors across
   many forms.

   [form status listing forthcoming]

-  **API**

   The ReSTful API is read-only and provides a complete accounting of
   form fields: data type, size and position on page, and role in field
   groupings like dollars-and-cents fields, fields on the same line,
   fields in the same table, fields on the same page, and fields
   involved in the same formula. The API will also provide status
   information and tester feedback for each form.

   [API docs forthcoming, for now see examples in
   test/run\_apiclient.sh]

-  **How it works**

   Most of the IRS tax forms embed all the fillable field information in
   the `XML Forms Architecture <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFA>`__
   (XFA) format. The OpenTaxForms `python <https://www.python.org/>`__
   script extracts the XFA from each PDF form, and parses out:

   -  relationships among fields (such as dollar and cent fields; fields
      on the same line; columns and rows of a table).
   -  math formulas, including which fields are computed vs user-entered
      (such as "Subtract line 37 from line 35. If line 37 is greaterthan
      line 35, enter -0-").
   -  references to other forms

   All this information is stored in a database (optionally
   `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`__ or the default
   (sqlite)[https://sqlite.org/]) and served according to a
   `ReSTful <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`__
   API. For each tax form page, an html form (with javascript to express
   the formulas) is generated and overlaid on an svg rendering of the
   original PDF. The javascript saves all user inputs to local/web
   storage in the browser via
   `basil.js <https://wisembly.github.io/basil.js/>`__. When the page is
   loaded, those values are retrieved. Values are keyed by tax year,
   form number (eg 1040), and XFA field id (and soon taxpayer name now
   that I do my kids' taxes too). Testers will annotate the page image
   with boxes and comments via
   `annotorious.js <http://annotorious.github.io/>`__. A few of the 900+
   IRS forms don't have embedded XFA (such as 2016 Form 1040 Schedule
   A). Eventually those forms may be updated to contain XFA, but until
   then, the best automated approach is probably
   `OCR <link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition>`__
   (optical character recognition). OCR maybe a less fool-proof approach
   in general, especially for state (NJ, NY, etc) forms, which generally
   are not XFA-based.

-  **To do**

   -  Replace ToDo with a link to github/issues.
   -  Refactor toward a less script-ish architecture that will scale to
      more developers. [architecturePlease]
   -  Switch to a pdf-to-svg converter that preserves text (rather than
      converting text to paths), perhaps pdfjs, so that testers can
      easily copy and paste text from forms. [copyableText]
   -  Should extractFillableFields.py be a separate project called
      xfadump? [xfadump] This might provide a cleaner target output
      interface for an OCR effort.
   -  Replace allpdfnames.txt with a more detailed form dictionary via a
      preprocess step. [formDictionary]
   -  Offer entire-form html interface (currently presenting each page
      separately). [formAsSingleHtmlPage]
   -  Incorporate instructions and publications, especially extracting
      the worksheets from instructions. [worksheets]
   -  Add the ability to process US state forms. [stateForms]
   -  Fix countless bugs, especially in forms that contain tables (see
      [issues])
   -  Don't seek in a separate file a schedule that occurs within a
      form. [refsToEmbeddedSchedules]
   -  Take any needed action regarding this from tox.readthedocs.io:
      Warning Integrating tox with setup.py test is as of October 2016
      discouraged as it breaks packaging/testing approaches as used by
      downstream distributions which expect setup.py test to run tests
      with the invocation interpreter rather than setting up many
      virtualenvs and installing packages. [toxSansSetup]
   -  separate dirName into pdfInputDir,htmlOutputDir [splitIoDirs]

0.4.14 (2016-12-31)

-  mv math.py cmds.py: workaround for tox build failure [tox.Random
   imports py.math and gets our math.py instead].
-  oops apparently gotta incl README for travis build to succeed.
-  setup.cfg: git flow release already tags the release, so we dont want
   bumpversion to do so, otherwise git flow refuses to release.

0.4.13 (2016-12-30)

-  gitignore release.sh temp files so they dont affect git status.
-  move most of 1100-line main into four new files.
-  add Form class.
-  domain.py->irs.py.
-  extractFillableFields.El derives from dict.
-  combined rst format files into a single README file.
-  noticed markdown readme is not rendered on pypi, fixing [part of fix
   is in release.sh].

0.4.12 (2016-12-23) - bind arrow keys to next/prev page links [for demo
video]. - [release.sh remains untracked while it is being tested.]

0.4.11 (2016-12-21) - allow multiple 'rootForms' via call or
commandline. - output form statuses for external processing. - clean up
"import \*". - add cleanup script. - merge the missing and spurious
categories into the form status message. - use bumpversion as
cookiecutter does.
